Split It is a web-based decentralized application that begun as a demo in this tutorial video (mostly part 2): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9WLo33KfCY

It allows someone to create a smart contract that can be used to recieve payments either from customers in a business or for splitting money between accounts in some other use case.

A pre-set list of "employee" addresses is added when creating the contract... and then when money is recieved at the address, they call the withdraw function to recieve their portion.

Since creating the original smart contract demoed in the video, we are now building an interface for it so people can interact with a web-based UI using mist or metamask.
